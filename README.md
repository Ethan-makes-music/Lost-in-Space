# Lost-in-Space
A game I made in Love2d in around a day

#How to Build:
So first you have to install visual studio code: https://code.visualstudio.com and then download the Love2D support extension

then you have to download LOVE: https://love2d.org and then when you did all of that you have to put the lovetest file somewhere (preferably on your desktop) then open the main.lua file in visual studio code. Then when you open it press alt + L to open your game. or another way to open it is to just drag the lovetest file into love.exe

if you couldent follow the instruction heres a good video on the topic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wttKHL90Ank

#Thanks
Thank you for downloading this game :)
